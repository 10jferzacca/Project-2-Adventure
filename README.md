# Project-2 - Adventure Project

## User Story
Adventure Project is a Full Stack Web Application built during my time at General Assembly in a Software Engineering Immersive Program. The idea of Adventure Project comes from a desire to share adventures with the community. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Handlebars and Mongoose I created a full-stack application to help the outdoor enthusiests show, create, edit and delete there adventures in a blog style format.
### Successes
Some successes were the ability to add and allow users to had images

### Things to work on  and difficulties
Some difficulties were seperating types of adventures so then there could be a specific page for each type of advenutre.
